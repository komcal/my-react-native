# My React-native
I have learned React-native for a month and I create an app for my company that I'm intern by React-native.

Because I use Linux then I create only Android and my team will port to IOS by the same code!

React-native is good for me because I'm a beginner in Java and I just make a basic app Android, but I'm a web developer I love Javascript and I know React.

I will talk about the pros and cons that I think.

###Pros
- React-native build native app. Don't worry about performance.
- You don't have to know about java or Objective-C. You just need to know how this app works.
- It's faster if you're good at Javascript es6, React, Redux.
- React is look like XML but it can do more than XML, JS look like java but It's asynchronous!!

###Cons
- If you are a beginner of Javascript I think it might be hard.
- React-native use only flex-box and didn't support many css style so it's hard to make it exactly look like your designs. 
- It's new, some packages are still have bugs. Sometime you must fix them before you use it.
- You must have learning curve to write some greate apps.
