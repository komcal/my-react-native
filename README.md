# my-react-native
I have learned react-native for 1 month and I create app to my company that I'm intern by react-native.

Because I use linux then I create only android and my team will port to ios by the same code!

React-native is good for me because I'm a beginer in Java and I just make basic app android but I'm a web developer I love Javascript and I know React.

I will talk about pros and cons that I think.

###Pros
- React-native build native app. Don't worry about performance.
- You don't have to know about java or Object-C. You just know how app can run.
- If you are greate Javascript es6, React, Redex you will create app very fast.
- React look like XML but React can do more than XML, JS look like java but JS is asynchronous!!

###Cons
- If you are beginner Javascript it will be hard to do.
- React-native use only flex-box and not support many css style, it hard to create 100% same design
- It's new, some package still have bug. Sometime you must fix package before use it.
- You must have learning curve to write a greate app.
